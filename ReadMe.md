# Unity Auto Build

## How To Build

Clone the repo. Install [Nim](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim), then run `nimble build` inside the root directory of the cloned repo.
Optionally run `nimble install` to have it install and place it in your path, so it does not require naviagating to the project directory.

Populate the config.json with actual data.

Finally run `./unity-auto-builder /path/to/config.json`
